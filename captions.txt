Deal with it.
But then, you knew that already.
STOP LYING TO YOURSELF.
And everyone knows it.
Your friends were afraid to tell you.
The first step is admitting it.
Which explains the smell.
But no one will ever believe you.
Don't even pretend you didn't know that.
You've always known.
It's why they whisper behind your back.
Known for your many attributes.
Look into you heart, you know I'm right.
They fear you, you know, they all fear you.
Invincible!
Get over it.
Now get over yourself.
Think about it, it explains so much.
You'll never find peace until you accept it.
That old woman was right about you.
The shaman saw it in you, didn't he?
As foretold in prophecy.
Behold!
We're done here.
The best animal. The very best.
It's what you wanted, admit it.
You disgust me.
Dirty. So very, very, dirty.
You should be ashamed.
So stop with the jokes already.
Happy now?
Or something. Whatever.
Seriously.
But death comes for us all in the end.
They're all staring at you.
But really, are you? I mean, really?
Now leave me alone already.
What were you expecting, Batman?
The Predator becomes the Prey.
Snuggly!
This will show them, this will show them all.
Surely now they will like you?
Print this for proof.
You're so cute.
We think. You're kinda hard to read.
Try harder next time, maybe?
Which is why the carpet is such a mess.
You know, if you believe hard enough.
Such an improvement!
I didn't think you had it in you.
So have a little pride, why don't you?
Which is not an excuse, not an excuse at all.
They were your droppings all along.
Endangered... by LOVE!
So nutritious!
But look on the bright side... oh, never mind.
The Pet with the Sweat!
Not just for Christmas.
Not just for breakfast anymore.
The other, other white meat.
But you'll leave too, just like all the others.
Tasty!
According to your mom.
